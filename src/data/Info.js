            I am Programming enthusiast and fullstack Web developer.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Currently pursuing my BTech (Engineering) degree in Computer Science. 
            <br/>
            <br/>I'm very familiar with using frameworks, my websites are primarily hand-coded using HTML5, CSS3, SVG & JavaScript.
            With a strong emphasis on "Progressive Enhancement", I look for creative ways to push the boundaries of website front-end code without compromising on browser support and performance.  
            In a quest for always keeping myself updated, I read books ,attend Opensource Events.
